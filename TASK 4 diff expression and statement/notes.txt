//Expression

Definition: An expression is anything that produces a value when evaluated.

It can be simple or complex.

Example in JavaScript:

js
Copy code
5 + 3         // produces 8
"Hello"       // produces the string "Hello"
a * 2         // produces some value depending on a


//Statements

Definition: A statement is a complete instruction that performs an action.

Statements can contain expressions, but they are executed for their effect, not just to produce a value.

Example in JavaScript:

js
Copy code
let x = 5;      // variable declaration statement
if (x > 0) {    // if statement
    console.log("Positive"); // expression inside statement
}
