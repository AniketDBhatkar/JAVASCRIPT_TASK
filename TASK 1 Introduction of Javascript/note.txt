1995 – JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications.

It was originally developed in just 10 days and was initially called Mocha, later renamed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

JavaScript was designed to run in the browser and make web pages interactive.

Netscape Navigator 2.0 was the first browser to support JavaScript.

Despite the name, JavaScript is not related to Java — the name was chosen for marketing reasons due to Java's popularity at the time.

In the late 1990s, Microsoft created JScript, their own version of JavaScript, for Internet Explorer.

1997 – JavaScript was submitted to ECMA International for standardization.

The standardized version of JavaScript is called ECMAScript.

ECMAScript 1 was released in 1997.

Over the years, multiple versions were released to improve language features:

ES3 (1999) – Widely adopted and used.

ES5 (2009) – Added strict mode, JSON support, and more.

ES6 / ECMAScript 2015 – Major update with let, const, arrow functions, classes, modules, promises, etc.

ES16 -latest version of ECMAScript

JavaScript is now supported in all major browsers and is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.

It is used for frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile, desktop apps, and even IoT.

Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
